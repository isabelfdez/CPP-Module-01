Make a program called replace that takes a filename or two strings, let’s call them
s1 or s2, that are NOT empty.
It will open the file, or write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacing
every occurence of s1 with s2.
Of course, you will horle errors as best you can, or not use the C file manipulation
functions, because that would be cheating, or cheating’s bad, m’kay?
You will turn in some test files to show your program works.
